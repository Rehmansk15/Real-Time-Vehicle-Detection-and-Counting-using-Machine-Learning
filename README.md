# Real-Time-Vehicle-Detection-and-Counting-using-Machine-Learning
Project Description:  The Real-Time Vehicle Detection and Counting project is a machine learning-based system designed to detect and count vehicles in real-time using computer vision techniques.

# Key Features:

Vehicle Detection: Utilizes machine learning algorithms, particularly object detection models like YOLO (You Only Look Once), to detect vehicles in a video stream.

Counting Mechanism: Implements a mechanism to count the number of vehicles detected in real-time.

Real-Time Processing: Processes video frames in real-time to detect and count vehicles, making it suitable for applications such as traffic monitoring, congestion analysis, and automated toll systems.

Accuracy and Performance: Focuses on accuracy and performance optimization to ensure robust vehicle detection and counting even in varying environmental conditions.

Integration with Machine Learning Libraries: Integrates with popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for training and deploying the object detection models.

# Technologies Used:

Programming Languages: Python
Libraries and Frameworks: OpenCV, TensorFlow, YOLO (You Only Look Once)
Tools: IDEs like PyCharm or Jupyter Notebook, GPU acceleration for deep learning tasks
Project Goals:

The main goal of the project is to provide a reliable and efficient system for real-time vehicle detection and counting using machine learning techniques. This system aims to contribute to traffic management and surveillance efforts by automating the process of vehicle counting and providing accurate traffic data.

# Applications:

Traffic surveillance and management
